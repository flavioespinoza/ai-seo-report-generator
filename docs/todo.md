# TODO List

## Report History Improvements

- [ ] **docs-update-readme-and-cleanup**
  - Update README.md
  - Update all required docs and delete not required

- [ ] **flow-for-report-history-list**
  - Ensure the user can easily navigate between historical reports.
  - When a report is selected, display its details in the main report view.
  - Maintain smooth transitions between selections.

- [ ] **highlight-active-report**
  - When a report is selected, visually indicate it in the `ReportHistory` list.
  - Use a subtle background color or border to show the currently active report.
  - Ensure highlighting persists when navigating between components.

- [ ] **add-unique-mongodb-id**
  - Add a `_id` field to each report generated by the backend.
  - Display this unique ID within each item in the Report History List (for reference or debugging).
  - Confirm the ID is stored correctly when new reports are saved and retrieved via `/api/reports`.

- [ ] **replace-browser-confirm-with-radix-dialog**
  - Replace `confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this report?')` with a Radix UI `Dialog` component.
  - Include:
    - A title ("Delete Report?")
    - Description ("Are you sure you want to delete this report? This action cannot be undone.")
    - "Cancel" and "Delete" buttons, styled to match existing UI.
  - Ensure deletion only triggers once confirmed via the dialog.
  - Update `ReportHistory` to use this dialog instead of the browser confirm prompt.

- [ ] **scroll-to-top-when-viewing-report**
  - When the user clicks on a report in the Report History list, automatically scroll the window to the top of the page.
  - Improves UX by keeping the newly selected report immediately visible.

- [ ] **add-view-report-button**
  - Move the "view report" functionality into a dedicated button next to the Delete button.
  - The entire report card should no longer be clickable.
  - Ensure both buttons are aligned and responsive on mobile.
  - Keep the styling consistent with existing design tokens (`rounded-xl`, hover states, etc.).

- [ ] **fix-styling-of-markup-on-reports**
  - Clean up spacing, padding, and typography in the SEO report content.
  - Improve readability for AI feedback sections and metadata tables.
  - Standardize colors and borders for consistent visual hierarchy.
