# TODO List

## Report History Improvements

- [ ] **Docs**
  - Update README.md
  - Update all required docs and delete not required


- [ ] **Flow for Report History List**
  - Ensure the user can easily navigate between historical reports.
  - When a report is selected, display its details in the main report view.
  - Maintain smooth transitions between selections.

- [ ] **Highlight Active Report**
  - When a report is selected, visually indicate it in the `ReportHistory` list.
  - Use a subtle background color or border to show the currently active report.
  - Ensure highlighting persists when navigating between components.

- [ ] **Add Unique MongoDB ID**
  - Add a `_id` field to each report generated by the backend.
  - Display this unique ID within each item in the Report History List (for reference or debugging).
  - Confirm the ID is stored correctly when new reports are saved and retrieved via `/api/reports`.

- [ ] **Replace Browser Confirm with Radix UI Dialog**
  - Replace `confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this report?')` with a Radix UI `Dialog` component.
  - Include:
    - A title (“Delete Report?”)
    - Description (“Are you sure you want to delete this report? This action cannot be undone.”)
    - “Cancel” and “Delete” buttons, styled to match existing UI.
  - Ensure deletion only triggers once confirmed via the dialog.
  - Update `ReportHistory` to use this dialog instead of the browser confirm prompt.

- [ ] **Scroll to Top When Viewing a Report**
  - When the user clicks on a report in the Report History list, automatically scroll the window to the top of the page.
  - Improves UX by keeping the newly selected report immediately visible.

- [ ] **Add “View Report” Button**
  - Move the “view report” functionality into a dedicated button next to the Delete button.
  - The entire report card should no longer be clickable.
  - Ensure both buttons are aligned and responsive on mobile.
  - Keep the styling consistent with existing design tokens (`rounded-xl`, hover states, etc.).

- [ ] **Fix the Styling of the Markup on the Reports**
  - Clean up spacing, padding, and typography in the SEO report content.
  - Improve readability for AI feedback sections and metadata tables.
  - Standardize colors and borders for consistent visual hierarchy.

## Optional Future Enhancements

- [ ] Persist and restore selected report state across page reloads.
- [ ] Add loading skeleton or spinner for Report History list while fetching.
- [ ] Allow filtering or sorting of historical reports by date or domain.
- [ ] Add pagination or infinite scroll if the report list grows large.

### Notes
These updates improve **UI consistency**, **interaction clarity**, and **presentation quality** across the SEO report and history components.
