## 💬 Talking Points During Demo

### While Analyzing
"Notice the loading state here - we're scraping the website with Cheerio, sending the metadata to OpenAI's GPT-4 Mini, and saving everything to our SQLite database."

### Showing Results
"The metadata section shows everything we scraped - title length, description, H1 tags, and more. Below that is the AI-powered analysis with specific recommendations."

### Report History
"All reports are automatically saved so you can compare how a site's SEO changes over time. This is useful for tracking improvements."

### Code Architecture
"I've separated concerns into distinct layers - the scraper handles web scraping, OpenAI handles AI analysis, and the database layer handles persistence. This makes it easy to swap out components."

### Testing
"I've written comprehensive tests covering the scraper logic, validation, and all UI components. Let me show you..."

## 🎓 Follow-Up Questions & Answers

**Q: "How would you handle a site that requires authentication?"**
A: "Currently, Cheerio can't handle authenticated requests. I'd extend the scraper to accept optional auth headers, or integrate Puppeteer for complex authentication flows."

**Q: "What if the AI returns unhelpful feedback?"**
A: "The prompt is carefully structured to request specific sections. If quality is an issue, I can refine the prompt, add few-shot examples, or switch to GPT-4 for higher quality."

**Q: "How do you prevent abuse?"**
A: "Currently basic validation only. For production, I'd add rate limiting per IP, CAPTCHA for excessive use, and API authentication with usage quotas."
